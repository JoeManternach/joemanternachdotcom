                <h2>Internet Protocol</h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python and our imagination, my friend and I crafted an internet 
                    protocol. Utilizing TCP, we sent data packets, ACKs, and NACKs. To 
                    demonstrate our protocol, we created a video game called "Plant Protocol."
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    When the player starts the game, they are prompted with a login screen. 
                    From there, our protocol manages communication between the client and 
                    server. After the user logs in, the client sends a communication to the 
                    server with the player's username. The server then responds by sending 
                    the client the player's plants and other relevant information.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    At the end of the session, the client sends the server an updated version 
                    of the plant list and other information, such as hunger and thirst levels. 
                    Through this project, I learned how to set up server and client 
                    communications as well as multithreading.

                <h2>Heart Rate Monitor</h2>
                <p>
                    Using a two-stage operational amplifier, an infrared LED, some robust resistors, 
                    and the university's finest lab equipment, I created an operational heart 
                    rate monitoring system. The system is designed to power an LED when the oxygen 
                    levels in the blood are sufficiently high.


                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    The infrared LED transmitter and receiver detect the heart rate signal, which 
                    is then fed through a two-stage amplifier. This amplification process boosts 
                    the signal from millivolts to volts. Once amplified, the signal powers an LED, 
                    indicating to the user that their heart is beating.
